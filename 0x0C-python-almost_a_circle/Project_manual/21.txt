21. Let's draw it

#advanced

Update the class Base by adding the static method def draw(list_rectangles, list_squares): that opens a window and draws all the Rectangles and Squares:



You must use the Turtle graphics module

To install it: sudo apt-get install python3-tk

To make the GUI available outside your vagrant machine, add this line in your Vagrantfile: config.ssh.forward_x11 = true

No constraints for color, shape etc… be creative!

guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ cat 101-main.py

#!/usr/bin/python3

""" 101-main """

from models.base import Base

from models.rectangle import Rectangle

from models.square import Square



if __name__ == "__main__":



    list_rectangles = [Rectangle(100, 40), Rectangle(90, 110, 30, 10), Rectangle(20, 25, 110, 80)]

    list_squares = [Square(35), Square(15, 70, 50), Square(80, 30, 70)]



    Base.draw(list_rectangles, list_squares)



guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ ./101-main.py

....

Uncommented line in /etc/ssh/ssh_config that said # ForwardX11 no and change no to yes.

Then added line config.ssh.forward_agent = true to my Vagrantfile in addition to config.ssh.forward_x11 = true.

Halted my vm with vagrant halt and started it back up with vagrant up --provision then vagrant ssh.

If you get an error that looks like /usr/bin/xauth: timeout in locking authority file /home/vagrant/.Xauthority, then enter rm .Xauthority (you may have to sudo).

Logout and restart the vm with vagrant up --provision.

Test with xeyes. If Xquartz is installed on the Mac OS it should open in an Xquartz window.

It is your responsibility to request a review for this task from a peer before the project’s deadline. If no peers have been reviewed, you should request a review from a TA or staff member.
